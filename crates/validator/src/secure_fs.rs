//! Helpers for writing files that hold secrets or decide what a validator
//! signs: the API token, imported keystores and their passwords, and the
//! validator definitions file.
//!
//! `std::fs::write` and `File::create` land at whatever mode the platform
//! default gives them, `0644` under a standard umask on unix, which makes
//! every one of those files readable by any other local account. Lighthouse's
//! convention here is `0600`; everything in this crate that writes such a
//! file must go through one of these two functions instead, to actually
//! follow that convention rather than only claim to.

/// to overwrite outright: the API token, and the validator definitions file's
/// `.tmp` sibling (`ValidatorDefinitions::save` renames it into place, which
/// preserves the mode set here). Neither is named from attacker-influenced
/// input, so there is no symlink concern for these; see
