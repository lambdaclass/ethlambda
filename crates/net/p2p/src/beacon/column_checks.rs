//! The chain checks, run on every data column sidecar gossip did not accept,
//! before the chain actor gets it.
//!
//! The chain actor keeps a sidecar without checking it (only debug builds
//! check again), so a sidecar reaches it by one of two routes: gossip accepted
//! it, having run every rule already, or it came through here. What comes
//! through here:
//!
//! - a gossiped sidecar reported `Queue` or `Ignore(Overloaded)`, whose
//!   stateful checks stopped early or never ran;
//! - every `DataColumnsByRoot` and `DataColumnsByRange` answer;
//! - sidecars the chain actor had parked, handed back once the block they
//!   wait on imported (`BlockChainToP2P::check_data_column_sidecars`): a fulu
//!   sidecar's parent, a gloas sidecar's own block.
//!
//! Each sidecar is checked on a blocking thread, bounded by
//! [`P2PServer::column_check_permits`]. Unlike a gossip verdict, nothing here
//! has a deadline, so a sidecar with no free permit waits for one rather than
//! being dropped.
